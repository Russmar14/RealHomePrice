Description: This package will use a multiple linear regression model and a neural net to predict your home price. It uses data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset to train these models. The predict_Price function takes in a dataframe of your input values (bed, bath, house_size) and returns a predicted price to serveas a reference point for your home price.
